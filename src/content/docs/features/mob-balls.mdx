Mob balls are a feature in LumaMC where you can buy/craft Mob Balls to capture and release any mobs you may come across!
To obtain, you can buy mob balls from `/luminshop` for the price of 12 Lumins,

Or if you're Etheral rank ([purchased at the store](https://store.lumamc.net)), you can craft them.
