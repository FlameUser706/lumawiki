Pinata parties are a fun and rewarding event for players!

Use `/pinata` to join the arena and start breaking them open to earn rewards. As you collect prizes,
notifications will appear in the chat. Make sure you have inventory space!

These parties happen every *50 server votes*, so be sure to join in when one starts!

Pinata parties may also be started from pinata party spawn orbs, which can be obtained from crates!
