## What are Tags?

Stand out on the server with custom tags! They‚Äôre a fun and creative way to show off your
personality. You can get them from crates, server events, tag orbs, or even our online store!

## Tag Orbs

You can find Zoe near spawn. Click on her to open the shop, where you can buy Tag orbs using in-game
currency. Tag orbs are also available in our online store!

Right-clicking on a tag orb will give you a random tag from a set of available options. Below are
all the tags you can currently get from the orb!

<CenteredImage src={tagList} alt="Tag list" tailwind="w-150" />

## Custom Tags

Show off your creativity with a custom tag! You can create your own unique tag using a Custom Tag
Voucher.

These vouchers are available for purchase in our online store, or you can earn them by participating
in server events. Use the voucher to design a tag that truly represents your style and personality.

Just remember to check the custom tag rules to make sure your design follows the server guidelines.
