LumaMC has many distinctive tools and sets, categorized into groups based on their rarities. These
coveted items can be acquired through a diverse range of methods, adding a layer of excitement and
variety to weapons and tools!

## Relics

Relics are items that can be obtained through killing mobs or working jobs! Consisting of mostly
weak vanilla enchants, they may not be as strong as Lunar or Astral tools, however, they can still
be super helpful and valuble!

#### The three rarities of Relics are:

<div class="list">

- **Nova (rare)**
- **Pulsar (uncommon)**
- **Solar (common)**

</div>

The higher the rarity of the relic, the more valuble the enchants will be!

## Lunar Tools

Lunar tools are the highest value relic being the most strong, and powerful weapons before Astral
tools!

Lunar tools are obtained through a 'Lunar Orb' which you can get through crates, or by crafting!

The crafting recipe is as follows:

Surround a Lunar core with 8 Relic shards to get a Lunar Orb!

## Astral Tools

The highest-level items available through Orbs are Astral Tools! These tools often come in sets, so
try to collect them all! Some sets have set bonuses, meaning that wearing the entire set will grant
extra benefits!

You can obtain Astral Orbs through crates or by crafting them!

Surround an Astral core with 8 Relic shards to get an Astral Orb!

## Astral Upgrades

Upon opening an Astral Orb, an astral tool may be given to the player with a set of base enchants
and as a base material. Using upgrade cores, you're able to upgrade any Astral item's enchant and/or
it's material! To access the astral upgrade GUI, use: `/upgrade`.

Each Astral item has multiple upgrade tiers. Upon reaching the final tier, your Astral tool will
show **Astral+** in its tier. A single upgrade core is required for each tier.

## Disassembler

You can bring any relics, lunar items, or astral items to the disassembler and have them
disassembled for relic shards and various loot!

Simply hold your item, and click the disassembler to use it!

## Event Tools

Event tools and gear are items which are commonly only available for a limited amount of time either
from a seasonal event, challenge, or other event-related activities. Event item enchants can vary
greatly and be very powerful depending on the tool. Event items cannot be upgraded, or modified in
any way other than renaming or modifying the lore of the item.
