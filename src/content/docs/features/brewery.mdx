## Getting Recipes

### Potion Recipes

Potion recipes are hidden throughout different worlds and can be found in loot chests! Each recipe
comes with a list of specific ingredients and instructions to help you craft its potion.

To check your collection, grab a Recipe Book from the Brewmaster at `/brewing`!

### Ingredients

Potion crafting uses everything from common items like sugar to custom ingredients like fruits.
Explore the world to gather what you need! Some may be easy to find, while others not so much.

Breaking grass yields a chance to drop fruit seeds. These seeds can then be used to grow fruit
plants, or may be used as potion ingredients.

## Brewing Potions

Get started by Placing a fire underneath a cauldron! Make sure to fill the cauldron with water. This
will act as your base to brew potions.

Grab your recipe, and put all ingredients inside the cauldron as listed! Once all your ingredients
are in the cauldron, simply right-click with the clock to start the timer!

Once enough time has passed (as listed in your recipe) grab the cauldron beverage with water
bottles!

However, some recipes don't end here. Some still require you to age or distill the beverage!

## Distilling

To distill a drink, simply put them into an alchemy stand, and add glowstone dust. This should yield
new drinks!

## Aging Drinks

To age drinks, you need to use a barrel.

To create a barrel, simply place stairs in the same way as seen in the below pictures, and then
place a sign on the bottom right corner with the words "barrel" and a message in chat should confirm
the barrel's creation.

To use the barrel, simply right-click on the barrel and place the drinks inside! Leave the drinks
inside for as long as the recipe calls!

After you put your drinks in barrels, you need to just wait! 
1 "year" = 1 in-game day. If you overdo the drink or use the wrong type of wood, the drink is likely to spoil.

## Drunken Effects

Drinking specific drinks may affect your alcohol percentage! Careful not to drink too much or you'll
be stumbling around!
