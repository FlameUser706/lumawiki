We use Bolt to protect containers! By default, chests are automatically protected on Luma.

### How to protect a container

Use `/lock` to protect a chest or another container, door, or block. This will prevent other players
from accessing the container's contents.

### How to Unlock a container

Use `/unlock` to unlock a chest or another container, door, or block. This will allow other players
to access the container's contents.

### How to share containers

<div class="list">

- `/trust add <player>` - Trusts a player to ALL your containers, allowing them to access the
  container's contents.
- `/trust remove <player>` - Removes a player's trust from ALL your containers.
- `/trust list` - Lists all players trusted to your containers.

</div>
