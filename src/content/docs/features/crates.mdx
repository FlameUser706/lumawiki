Crates are full of great rewards, with better prizes the higher the tier! 

To open a crate, you’ll need a key that matches its tier. The current tiers, ranked least to most
valuble are:

**Solara --> Iris --> Azure --> Etherea --> Luma**

You can find crates at `/crates`.

<CenteredImage src={crates} alt="Crates" tailwind="w-160" />

To check the contents of each crate, simply left-click on a crate! To use a crate key, right-click
on the crate while holding the key in your main hand.

<CenteredImage src={cratesView} alt="Crates View" tailwind="w-100" />

Crate keys can be obtained
from voting, daily rewards, server events, and the LumaMC store!
