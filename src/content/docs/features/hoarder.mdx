Hoarder allows you to sell excess items for rewards!

Every so often, the hoarder will request specific items. Selling the item to the hoarder will give
you points and money to compete with fellow players!

When the hoarder's timer resets, the top 4 players with the most points will be rewarded from the
treasure pool!
