Trying to decide where to build your town? Consider our seasons world!

The seasonal world undergoes updates to mirror the real-world seasons! The world's active time,
date, and season will match `NA-EAST`.

Certain events will happen during different seasons too such as shooting stars in summer or night
sparkels in winter!

## Common Commands

<div class="list">

- `/biome` - View the current vanilla biome.
- `/season` - Displays the current season, date, days until next season, active events
- `/toggleseasoncolors` - Toggles the season colors (trees, grass, water, sky etc). Players with
  season colours disabled will just see the normal vanilla biomes.
- `/toggleseasonparticles` - Toggles all season particles. Season particles look weird with some
  shaders and this toggle will solve the problem.

</div>

## Season Transition Dates

- **Spring** - March 4th

- **Summer** - June 4th

- **Fall** - September 4th

- **Winter** - December 4th

You may see minor transitions happening in the days leading up to a season change!
