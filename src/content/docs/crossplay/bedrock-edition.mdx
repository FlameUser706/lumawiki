   unsure.

2. **In the 'Server Address' field:** Enter `play.lumamc.net`

3. **In the 'Port' field:** Leave this field as `19132` or input the default port, `19132` if not

## Limitations

On LumaMC, we allow connections from **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition** clients using Geyser.
Unfortunately, due to major differences between Bedrock and Java, there are features that are
unavailable for Bedrock clients until Mojang adds support for these features, or changes them to be
closer to their Java edition counterpart.

Please see Geyser's official wiki for an in-depth list as to what is not available:
https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/current-limitations/

In addition to Geyser's official list, there are a few Luma-specific features which are not on this
list. These include:

<div class="list">

- Unable to see unique water, folliage, and grass color in the Seasons world.
- Unable to see RGB colors (Geyser will still do it's best to map RGB colors to default Minecraft
  colors).
- Unable to see wraps, furniture while in inventory, and possibly other texture pack items.
- Unable to see player chat heads in chat.

</div>

### Offhand Support

Bedrock players are unable to put majority of items into their offhand natively. To force a specific
item into your offhand as a bedrock player, hold the item in your main hand and use: `/offhand` (or
`/ofh` for short).

## Account Linking

_Play from anywhere!_

As stated before, Luma uses Geyser as its Bedrock packet converter. Because of this, players who own
both a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition account are able to link their
accounts and save their data together. Inventories, town status, playervaults, and anything else
will be stored on the Java edition account and when logging in on a bedrock client, Geyser will
mimic you being logged in as your Java edition account. To link accounts, visit
[link.geysermc.org](https://link.geysermc.org/) or use `/linkaccount` in-game.

## Did You Know?

**Minecraft: Bedrock Edition** and **Minecraft: Java Edition** are now bundled together! That means
if you own **Minecraft: Java Edition** you also have a copy of Bedrock edition you can use on any
Windows 10/11 PC. Likewise, this means that if you own Bedrock edition on PC, you also own Java
edition too! Additionally, Xbox Gamepass now includes both versions of Minecraft within it and
you're able to play either copies on Xbox or PC while having a subscription.

## Support
