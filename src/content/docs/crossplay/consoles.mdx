If you're on a version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition which prevents you from adding external
servers, don't worry! You still have other ways to connect to LumaMC!

## Connect using Xbox LIVE Friends

When using a Bedrock client, you can connect to Luma by following **PlayLumaMC** on Xbox LIVE!

### While in Minecraft...

Head to the **Friends** tab and click **Add Friend**. While in this tab, click **Search for a
gamertag** and search up `PlayLumaMC`. LumaMC's Xbox LIVE friend profile should pop up. After adding
the account, close out Minecraft and restart your game. You should now see `PlayLumaMC` as a
joinable friend in your **Friends** tab. Click to join and you're all done!

### While on the web...

Make sure you're signed into your Xbox account at [xbox.com](https://xbox.com/). Next, follow
LumaMC's Xbox profile: https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/user/PlayLumaMC. After following LumaMC's
xbox profile, start your game and head over to the **Friends** tab. You now should see `PlayLumaMC`
as a joinable friend. Click to join and you're all done!

## Other Options

If you're on a console edition (e.g. Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation), but still can't join
LumaMC through the **Friends** tab. Try using a self-hosted solution! See Geyser's documentation for
setting one up and getting started here: https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/using-geyser-with-consoles
