To ensure a fair experience and also prevent lag from being a concern on Luma, we must enforce hard
limits on entities and certain block types. The limits for each are listed below.

## Entity Limits

<Aside>
  A group is defined as a collection of entities within a specific radius. Example: A group of 10
  zombies spread out 8 blocks away from a group of 20 zombies wouldn't be trimmed but a group of 30
  zombies would.
</Aside>

<div class="list">

- Common mobs (animals, monsters, fish, ambient, raiders) are all limited under a **25** group limit
  per `14` blocks.
- Domestic mobs (villagers, tameables, golems) are all limited under a **45** group limit per `6`
  blocks.
- Vehicle entities (minecarts, hopper minecarts, boats) are all limited under a **15** limit per
  `20` blocks.

</div>

## Block Limits

<Aside>
  A chunk is a 16x320x16 region spread out across all worlds in Minecraft. You can see individual
  chunks by enabling the F3+G debug menu.
</Aside>

<div class="list">

- Redstone blocks are limited under a **90** block limit per `chunk`.
- Beds are limited under a **20** block limit per `chunk`.
- Hoppers are limited under a **25** block limit per `chunk`.
- Tiles are limited under a **256** block limit per `chunk`.
- Spawners are limited under an **8** block limit per `chunk`.

</div>
