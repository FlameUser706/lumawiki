LumaMC offers an extensive range of ranks that players can progress through, each providing a wealth
of benefits and enjoyable perks!

These ranks fall into two distinct categories: those earned through in-game currency and those
available for purchase in our store.

Both rank systems are designed to be balanced and fair, ensuring that all players have an equal
opportunity to progress and enjoy the Luma!

<Aside>
  For a detailed list of perks on each rank, see `/ranks` in-game. For store ranks, visit our
  [store](https://store.lumamc.net).
